This is an implementation of the Library project from The Odin Project Full Stack Javascript path.

This application allows you to enter new books by providing the title, author, number of pages, and whether or not it has been read. Books that have been read will appear in light green while books that haven't appear in light red. The read status can be toggled on the book card that is displayed by clicking the appropriate radio button.

The primary skills/technologies practiced as part of this project include:

1. Javascript object constructors and direct prototype modification instead of using ES6 class syntax
2. Dynamic html generation using vanilla javascript instead of other templating techniques
3. localStorage API implementation so that app data can be persisted across site visits
